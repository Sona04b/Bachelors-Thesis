ðŸ§« Detection and Quantification of TB Bacilli in Sputum Smear Images

An academic research project and Bachelorâ€™s thesis focused on automating the detection and quantification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli from ZN-stained sputum smear microscopy images using computer vision and machine-learning techniques.

The repository includes a lightweight Flask web app for real-time image analysis and interactive visualization, along with model-training notebooks (Random Forest, CNN, ViT, EfficientNet) and sample data for reproducibility.
