# Detection and Quantification of TB Bacilli in Sputum Smear Images 

INTRODUCTION

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a leading cause of infectious disease-related deaths worldwide, especially in low-resource settings. Traditional diagnostic methods, reliant on expert analysis and microscopy, are time-consuming and prone to errors. This project proposes an AI-powered automated system to detect TB bacilli in sputum smear images, leveraging advanced deep learning models like ResNet50 and DenseNet. By automating the diagnostic process, the project aims to reduce human error, improve diagnostic speed, and expand access to healthcare in underserved regions. This technology aligns with global efforts to control TB and represents a significant advancement in medical AI applications.

BACKGROUND ON TUBERCULOSIS AND IT’S GLOBAL IMPACT

Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily affects the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. It is a major public health issue, with millions of new cases diagnosed globally each year, particularly in low and middle-income countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent, ranking above HIV/AIDS. The spread of TB is exacerbated by socioeconomic factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and overcrowding, especially in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. TB’s airborne nature further complicates containment efforts, making it essential to have early, accurate, and widespread diagnostic capabilities. 

AI AND IT’S ROLE IN REVOLUTIONIZING TB DIAGNOSIS

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) technologies in recent years has shown great promise in medical diagnostics, particularly in automating image analysis tasks traditionally performed by human experts. AI-based systems can process images rapidly, identify patterns, and classify objects with high precision. For TB diagnostics, this means that automated systems can analyze sputum smear images, detect bacilli, and provide diagnostic outcomes without the need for human intervention, significantly speeding up the process. Moreover, AI models can be trained to recognize a wide variety of image conditions, thus improving consistency and reducing diagnostic errors even when bacillary loads are low. The application of AI in this domain not only addresses the limitations of traditional methods but also provides scalable solutions that can be deployed in mobile health clinics and other remote healthcare settings.
